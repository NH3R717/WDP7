## Key Features

### In and Out Intuitive

The app’s user interface will be designed to be efficiently navigable for working personnel in field conditions. Notification will be the center of the apps functionality and will be prominently displayed in list form on the apps main/home screen. All navigation points within the app are designed to be accessible with the least amount of user input and will be be of a size that is easily screen selectable by “busy hands”.

### Notifications

Notifications are set at the home screen of the app. Users can send notifications to each other or groups with the following media types: text, audio, video which may include route linking. Displayed in stacked list format each notification has an icon indicators for who the message was sent from as well as urgency/situation level indication. Sender of notifications will have the option to require a response (which would be logged by time and date and returned to the sender) to clear messages from view.

### Direct Messaging/Notification Response

Direct messaging can be done between individual users and groups. Users may reference a notification (respond to) in their direct message or start or continue one without notification reference. Format and media types for direct message include text, audio or video response and may include a route link.

### Client data control archiving and review

Clients will have their choice of hosting options with dashboard access to all messaging and notification data sent, current and archived. This gives the user enhanced security in having control of their company’s data. With ready data access that includes timestamped messages and notifications clients can refer to these whenever the need arises.

### Responsive Design

With a responsive that is fully functional from the smallest mainstream phone with of 320px to desktop view-ability this web app is universally viewable across all major device forms. Clients can be confident that their users devices will work as intended on all of their user's devices.

## Use Cases

A client request a service call, one of it's three main boilers used for building heating are offline. The technician arrives to diagnosis the problem, make a repair and bring the problem equipment back online. As they are making the repair they find a situation they are not familiar with. With the Coms Management application the tech can take detailed photographs and videos of the problem equipment then push those to their senior technician and receive technical feedback from the senior them. 

## Problem Statement

The problem is a lack of ability for field service techs, managers and/or senior technicians to relay complex information to and from each other with an application that has an interface that is most suitable for this specific user group needs. Current market turnkey solutions for field service management fall short in interface and in addressing needs of client data control, archiving and communication medium options. Coms Management is a bespoke solution tailored to clients specific needs which addresses these problems.

## Solution Statement

Coms Management allows field technicians and senior technicians to relay detailed messages between each other through text, audio and video medium in real time. These messages can be archived and viewed at a later time if the need arises.

## Pain Points

A HVAC technician is making a field repair and finds a problem can not solve, the options are a voice call or send other media via a IM service such as Facebook messenger. But these solutions do not provide an interface or experience that is efficient for field technician work.

A part was replaced on a client's chiller 6 months ago, the chiller in now inoperable. The client claims that the repair was done incorrectly and that the part replaced was of the wrong type. With a archival messaging service the repair tech could have documented the repair with audio, video or text and them pushed that information to the company's server as a message. The message could then be viewed in time of need to confirm the details of the repair.

### kickserv

kickserv’s (all lowercase) has the look and feel of a templated business laden with shines stock photo, testimonials, “proven abilities”, etc. but lacks an identity from my perspective. Lacking identity is also supported by the lack of office location displayed within the website.
