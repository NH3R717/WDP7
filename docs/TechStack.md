# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.

## Adobe XD

(You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.)

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
I've used XD in previous courses for prototyping purposes. During that class I also looked into using Figma and Sketch and  found that being familiar with Adobe CC apps and XD alignment tools were must haves for my prototyping workflow. I am exceptionally comfortable using Adobe XD

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
I do not want to be locked into Adobe's eco system. I would like to find alternative for all of my Adobe app needs.

## React

(You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.)

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I can establish a React app CLI and set-up components, state and props.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
React workflow and structure paradigms are still a bit confusing to me, I hope to clear this up.

## Redux

(Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.)

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
I do nto feel very comfortable using Redux, this is something I need to learn more about.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
"I do not feel very comfortable using Redux, this is something I need to learn more about, Redux was presented in ASL but unfortunately the high workload of that class did not allow me time to spend much time learning it.

## Node

(You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.)

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**

I feel my ability to implement new Javascript within Node is intermediate at best. 

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
I understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript thus writing applications for NodeJS, but am less knowledgeable about implementation and best practice. As I progress through WDD I add knowledge and skills in this area, I will continue this trend.

## Express

(You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.)

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
Express being an established and light weight server-side framework I feel like it fits my workflow.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
I feel finding solutions to problems with Express on https://expressjs.com/ is very intuitive.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

(You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.)

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
Sequalize is a Object Relation Mapping (ORM) solution that I've used in my previous class. It allowed me to communicate/query my app's Postgres database instance with javascript code. ORMs can add unnecessary overhead, but also adds useful like query validation

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
Looking at the Sequalize doc at https://sequelize.org/v5/ it intuitive similar to the express docs and could find answers to my problems there.
